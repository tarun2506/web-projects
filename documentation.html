            <p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell labs in 1979, as an extension to the C language.C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system
                resources and memory.The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.</p>
            <p>C# is a general-purpose, modern and object-oriented programming language pronounced as “C sharp”. It was developed by Microsoft led by Anders Hejlsberg and his team within the .Net initiative and was approved by the European Computer Manufacturers
                Association (ECMA) and International Standards Organization (ISO). C# is among the languages for Common Language Infrastructure and the current version of C# is version 7.2. C# is a lot similar to Java syntactically and is easy for the
                users who have knowledge of C, C++ or Java.</p>

                    <h2>Declaring variables</h2>
                </header>
                <p>A variable is a name given to a storage area that is used to store values of various data types. Each variable in C# needs to have a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory.For example, a variable can
                    be of the type String, which means that it will be used to store a string value. Based on the data type, specific operations can be carried out on the variable.For instance, if we had an Integer variable, then operations such as addition
                    and subtraction can be carried out on the variable. One can declare multiple variables in a program.</p>
                <p>In C++ variable is used to store data in a memory location, which can be modified or used in the program during program execution.</p>
                <p>Variables play a significant role in constructing a program, storing values in memory and dealing with them. Variables are required in various functions of every program. For example, when we check for conditions to execute a block of
                    statements, variables are required. Again for iterating or repeating a block of the statement(s) several times, a counter variable is set along with a condition, or simply if we store the age of an employee, we need an integer type
                    variable. So in every respect, the variable is used. In this tutorial, you will learn about how variables are declared in C++, how to assign values to them, and how to use them within a C++ program.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>To fully comprehend the differences between C and C++, you need an understanding of what object-oriented programming is. The term object-oriented, as it relates to programming, originated at MIT in the late 50s or early 60s.Object-oriented
                        programming (or OOP) uses a concept called “objects.” An object is an instance of a “class,” or a program-code-template. A class can be made up of data or code procedures (also known as methods).</p>
                    <p>The original C programming language is not object-oriented, which is the most significant difference between the two. C is what’s called a “procedural” programming language, while C++ is a hybrid language that’s a combination of procedural
                        and object-oriented.</p>
