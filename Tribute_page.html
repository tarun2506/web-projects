    Albert Einstein (14 March 1879–18 April 1955) was a German-born scientist.[4] He worked on theoretical physics.[5] He developed the theory of relativity.[3][6] He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for theoretical physics. His famous equation is {\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}{\displaystyle E=mc^{2}} (E = energy, m = mass, c = speed of light).

At the beginning of his career, Einstein did not think that Newtonian mechanics was enough to reconcile (bring together) the laws of classical mechanics and the laws of the electromagnetic field. Between 1902–1909 he developed the special theory of relativity to correct that. Einstein also thought that Isaac Newton's idea of gravity was not completely correct. So, he extended his ideas on special relativity to include gravity. In 1916 he published a paper on general relativity with his theory of gravitation.

In 1933, Einstein was visiting the United States.
<br> <br>
In Germany, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis came to power. Einstein, being of Jewish ethnicity, did not return to Germany due to the Hitler’s anti-Semitic policies.[7] He lived in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.[8] On the beginning of World War II, he sent a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt explaining to him that Germany was in the process of making a nuclear weapon; so Einstein recommended that the US should also make one. This led to the Manhattan Project, and the US became the first nation in history to create and use the atomic bomb (not on Germany though but Japan). Einstein and other physicists like Richard Feynman who worked on the Manhattan project later regretted that the bomb was used on Japan.[9]

Einstein lived in Princeton and was one of the first members invited to the Institute for Advanced Study, where he worked for the remainder of his life. He is widely considered one of the greatest scientists of all time. His contributions helped lay the foundations for all modern branches of physics, including quantum mechanics and relativity.

    Many scientists only care about their work, but Einstein also spoke and wrote often about politics and world peace. He liked the ideas of socialism and of having only one government for the whole world. He also worked for Zionism, the effort to try to create the new country of Israel.

Einstein's family was Jewish, but Einstein never practiced this religion seriously. He liked the ideas of the Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza and also thought that Buddhism was a good religion.[source?]

Even though Einstein thought of many ideas that helped scientists understand the world much better, he disagreed with some scientific theories that other scientists liked. The theory of quantum mechanics discusses things that can happen only with certain probabilities, which cannot be predicted with better precision no matter how much information we might have.
<br> <br>
This theoretical pursuit is different from statistical mechanics, in which Einstein did important work. Einstein did not like the part of quantum theory that denied anything more than the probability that something would be found to be true of something when it was actually measured; he thought that it should be possible to predict anything, if we had the correct theory and enough information. He once said, "I do not believe that God plays dice with the Universe."

Because Einstein helped science so much, his name is now used for several different things. A unit used in photochemistry was named for him. It is equal to Avogadro's number multiplied by the energy of one photon of light. The chemical element Einsteinium is named after the scientist as well.[19] In slang, we sometimes call a very smart person an "Einstein."
